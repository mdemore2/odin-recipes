    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Toast is sliced bread that has been browned by radiant heat. 
        The browning is the result of a Maillard reaction, which is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that occurs when food is cooked. 
        The Maillard reaction gives toast its characteristic flavor and aroma.
    </p>
    <p>
        Toast can be made in a toaster, toaster oven, or under a broiler. 
        The degree of browning can be controlled by the amount of time the bread is exposed to heat. 
        Toast can be eaten plain or topped with butter, jam, peanut butter, avocado, or other toppings. 
        It can also be used to make sandwiches, french toast, or croutons.
