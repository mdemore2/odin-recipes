        To make bread pudding, the stale bread is cubed and soaked in a mixture of milk, eggs, and sugar. 
        The mixture is then baked in a dish until the bread is cooked through and the custard is set. 
        Bread pudding can be served warm or cold, and it is often topped with a sauce, such as a caramel sauce or a custard sauce.
