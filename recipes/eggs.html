    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A soft-boiled egg is an egg that has been boiled for a short period of time, so that the white is set but the yolk is still soft and runny. 
        The texture of the white should be firm but not rubbery, and the yolk should be slightly runny and velvety. 
        The ideal cooking time for a soft-boiled egg will vary depending on the size of the egg, but it is typically around 5-7 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Soft-boiled eggs can be eaten plain or topped with salt, pepper, or your favorite seasonings. 
        They can also be used in a variety of dishes, such as salads, sandwiches, and sushi.
